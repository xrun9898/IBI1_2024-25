i am curious about the DALYs changed in China over time
i will plot the line graph containing Chinese data with the x-axis years and y-axis DALYs
it is expected to find the trend of Chinese DALYs changes 

so the question is question: How has the DALYs changed in China over time

the program is start from line 35

discussion: The plot shows a general decrease in DALYs,then i compare 
the DALYs between two adjacent year and find every year is lower then 
the last year, so it is decreasing.
