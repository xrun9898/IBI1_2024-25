The length and subcellular localisation	of the human SOD2 protein is 222 amino aicds and it is localised in the mitochondrion matrix

The	range of percentage	identities in the reported online BLAST	results is from 58.1 to 100%

The	alignment score	and	percentage of identical	amino acids	for	each of	the	three comparisons that you performed using Python:
    The Hamming distance between human and mouse SOD2 sequences is: 1097.0, and the percentage of identical amino acids is: 90.09009009009009%
    The Hamming distance between human SOD2 sequence and random sequence is: -216.0, and the percentage of identical amino acids is: 4.954954954954955%
    The Hamming distance between mouse SOD2 sequence and random sequence is: -195.0, and the percentage of identical amino acids is: 5.8558558558558556%

As the results, the human SOD2 protein sequence and the mouse SOD2 sequence are most closely related.
